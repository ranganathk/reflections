How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It was ok. The files were a little hard to read. 
I hope in the future I find it more useful.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I would love to have easy access to the entire history of a file but it is space consuming and most of the time we never use it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros: More flexible and logical. Computer uses only required space.
Cons: Some changes may be missed. Prone to human errors like too large or small commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Changes in one file may affect other files and hence it is necessary to track all files, like adding a button causes changes in the html, the css and the js file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log gives us the list of all commits and git diff helps us find the changes made in each commit helping us find where exactly a particular change was made.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

It is like looking for a needle in a haystack. I hope I am able to use version-control.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Help me in sharing my work with others and reducing my burden. Also to make me more efficient.
