What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a git repository inside the file where git checks the status of all the files in this repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory has files which are both tracked and untracked while the staging area has only tracked files that are ready to be commited.
