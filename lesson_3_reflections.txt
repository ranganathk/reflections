When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to keep my repository remote most of the time so that it can be accessed easily by others. 
I would surely keep a remote repository when I work on a project as a group. Moreover a remote repository 
keeps my files save upto the last pushed change in case my computer crashes.
